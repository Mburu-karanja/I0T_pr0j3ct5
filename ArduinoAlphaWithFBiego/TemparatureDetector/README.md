# Temperature Alert System
This project uses a temperature sensor connected to an Arduino Alpha board to monitor temperature and provide visual and audio feedback, LEDs turn off to indicate their range has been matched, while others stay on.

# What It Does
Continuously reads temperature from an analog sensor (A3)
All range LEDs (Cool, Normal, Hot) are ON by default
Depending on the temperature:
The corresponding range LED turns OFF to signal that condition
