# Tune the Arduino Alpha Style!
This project plays the “Happy Birthday” melody using a buzzer when a button is pressed. What’s cool, you can control the pitch and tempo in real-time using two potentiometers! Perfect for experimenting with musical tuning.

# What It Does
Plays the "Happy Birthday" song when the button is pressed

Use Pot 1 (A1) to tweak the pitch (0.8× to 1.2×)

Use Pot 2 (A2) to adjust the tempo (0.5× to 1.5×)

A bright LED lights up when the song is playing 

Can be used as a cool musical gift, fun school demo, or creative controller idea!
